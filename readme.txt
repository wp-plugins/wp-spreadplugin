== Frequently asked questions ==

= It shows "No articles in Shop", but there are articles in the Spreadshirt-Shop =

Check if your Spreadshirt Shop has a language and country setting.

= I want to use a different currency. Is this possible? =

The currency bases on the currency you're using for your Spreadshirt Shop. So if you want to use DKK instead of EUR, change the currency in the Shop options of your Spreadshirt Shop. But be sure to not have any products in your shop, because Spreadshirt doesn't allow changing it, when you've already products in it. (The solution would be to create a new shop) Please clear the cache of the Spreadplugin plugin in the Spreadplugin settings page when done (you may wait some hours to the spreadshirt cache to refresh).

= How do I get the category Id? =

1. You must have already created a category in your spreadshirt shop (http://www.spreadshirt.com/help-C1328/categoryId/3/articleId/147), if not, please do so, now. Please refer to spreadshirt, if you don't know how.
2. Please open your normal spreadshirt shop (shopid.spreadshirt.net). In my case: http://welovetee.spreadshirt.de/
3. Choose a category from the category selection.
4. The url of your shop has changed to `http://welovetee.spreadshirt.de/alsterwasser-C300890` in my case
5. The category Id in this case is `300890` (the numbers after the "-C" part)
6. Paste this number in the `shop_category=""` variable. In my case `shop_category="300890"`.
7. Save and done.

= How to display one category per page? (Custom categories) =

1. Please see `How do I get the category Id?` 
2. If you have got your category id, create a page in wordpress
3. Go to text mode
4. Paste extended shortcode (you don't need all values, just the one you want to overwrite) `[spreadplugin shop_category="CATEGORYID"]`
5. Save and repeat by each category you want to display.

= How to display one pre-defined category per page? =

1. Please see `How to display one category per page? (Custom categories)`
2. Instead of using shop_category, use `shop_productcategory` and one of your category names as values. Possible values are Men, Women, Kids & Babies,... But in your language.

= How to disable the social buttons? =

Add or change in the [spreadplugin] code the value from `shop_social="1"` to `shop_social="0"` or use the settings page.

= How to disable the product links? =

Add or change in the [spreadplugin] code the value from `shop_enablelink="1"` to `shop_enablelink="0"` or use the settings page.

= How to change the link targets? =

Add or change in the [spreadplugin] code the value from `shop_linktarget=""` to shop_linktarget="YOUR_IFRAME_NAME"` or whatever it is. Or use the settings page.

= I want my checkout page display in an iframe, what is to do? =

Add or change in the [spreadplugin] code the value from `shop_checkoutiframe="0"` to `shop_checkoutiframe="1"` or `shop_checkoutiframe="2"`. Note: shop_linktarget will be ignored. Or use the settings page.

* `shop_checkoutiframe="0"` opens basket in separate window
* `shop_checkoutiframe="1"` opens basket in an iframe in the page content 
* `shop_checkoutiframe="2"` opens basket in an iframe in a modal window 

= How to default sort? =

Add or change in the `[spreadplugin]` code the value from `shop_sortby=""` to `shop_sortby="name"`. Available sort options are name, price, recent. Or use the settings page.

= I get following error, when I add an article to the basket: "ERROR: Basket not ready yet." =

Please update to the most recent version

= How to active edit articles to use the designer shop? =

Activate by changing shop_designershop="0" to shop_designershop="DESIGNERSHOPID" where DESIGNERSHOPID is your designer shop ID. Or use the settings page.

= How to active designs view? =

Activate by changing shop_display="0" to shop_display="1" or change it in the admin panel. Or use the settings page.

= It shows old articles =

Please go to the settings page in the admin panel of the plugin and click "Rebuild cache". 

= I want to use more than one shop on the same website =

Please use the extended shortcode. 
This will overwrite the default plugin settings just for the page, where you have added this shortcode.

= The infinity scroll always repeats all of my articles on and on and on and.. =

This might be a problem resulting of a special URL structure (permalinks). In this case, please have a look at your wordpress settings -> permalinks. 
If you don't want to change this setting to another one, please let me know the structure to check it.

= The article description should be displayed without clicking "Show description". How to do it? =

Add or edit the shortcode or set in shortcode plugin settings to enable. Shortcode would be `shop_showdescription="1"` for enabling.

= I want to display one design per page =

Add or edit the shortcode you are using and add/change following variable `shop_design="DESIGNID"`.
You get the `DESIGNID` from your spreadshirt admin panel.

= If I checkout, the language differs from the language of the shop?! =

Please check your `Locale` setting in your user-data of spreadshirt.
You can find it here: http://www.spreadshirt.net/user-data-C162 or http://www.spreadshirt.com/user-data-C162

= How can I change the language of different shop instances? =

If you change the language in your wordpress installation, the language of the plugin changes, too. Well, but you can change the language only for the plugin by selecting your language in the spreadplugin options, now. If you have multiple pages with different shops on it and want to use a different language on each page, please use the shortcode and extend your already used shortcode by - for example `shop_language="de_DE"` - possible values are: de_DE, en_GB, fr_FR, nl_NL, nn_NO, nb_NO, da_DK, it_IT. Your new shortcode could look like this: `[spreadplugin shop_language="de_DE"]`

= "Rebuild cache" reads nothing, but Shop Id is correct! =

Change "Shop country:" to "None/Please choose" and click "Rebuild cache" again.

= Where do I find great website templates for wordpress? =

Please have a look here: http://themeforest.net/category/wordpress?ref=thimo
